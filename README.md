# Project 1: Movie Trailer Website
=============================

This is the code for the study of the "Full Stack Web Developer Nanodegree" on Udacity.



In this project, I have wrote server-side codes to store a list of favorite movies, including box art imagery and a movie trailer URL. 

Meanwhile, this data as a web page allowing visitors to review their movies and watch the trailers. 

1. Run entertainment_center.py.

You will have 4 choices which will be shown on the command line:

	1.Add a movie.
	2.Remove a movie.
	3.Show webpage
	4.Exit

2.
Input 1 to add the information of a movie.
Input 2 to remove a movie with inputed name.
Input 3 to generate and show a webpage for the movies you add.
Input 4 to exit.

3.After you input the information of the movies, you can input 3 to generate a html file as the one you see in this directory.


The command line is like:
